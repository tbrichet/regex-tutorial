## Purpose
This week's challenge was to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. This tutorial would be provided to a web development student so that he/she could understand the search pattern the regex defines.

## Project Requirements
* Upon opening the tutorial, the user sees a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author's Github profile. <br>
* When the user clicks on the links in the table of contents, user is taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial <br>
* When user reads through each section of the tutorial, user finds a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does <br>
* When user reaches the end of the tutorial, user finds a section  about the author and a link to the author's GitHub profile. <br>
